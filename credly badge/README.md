# 🚀 AWS Educate: Machine Learning Foundations

This project marks the culmination of my learning journey through the **AWS Educate Machine Learning Foundations** program, where algorithms meet the cloud, and curiosity meets capability.
From training simple models to understanding neural networks, I gained hands-on experience with real-world datasets and core ML techniques, all while exploring how AWS services bring machine learning to life at scale. 

Earning the [**Credly badge**](https://www.credly.com/badges/448d68ea-7584-458e-9e43-9f5618f6b966) wasn’t just a milestone, it was a launchpad into building intelligent, cloud-powered solutions for the future.
