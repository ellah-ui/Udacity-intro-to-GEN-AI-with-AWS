# Exercise: Create a Tech Gadget Customer Support Chatbot 🤖

Imagine you own an online store that sells a variety of tech gadgets. 
Customers frequently ask about product details, return policies, shipping options, and technical troubleshooting. 
Instead of handling every question manually, you decide to implement a simple chatbot to provide quick responses.

Your Chatbot Will Handle Queries Like:
- Product Information: “Tell me about product X”, “Do you have smartwatches?”
- Shipping Details: “How long does shipping take?”, “What shipping methods are available?”
- Return Policy: “What is your return policy?”, “How do I return a product?”
- Technical Support: “My gadget won’t turn on.”, “How do I reset my device?”
