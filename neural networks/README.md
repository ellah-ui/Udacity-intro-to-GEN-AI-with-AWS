# Exercise: Neural Networks

For this exercise, you will create a simple neural network example. We'll use a synthetic dataset to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on two features:

- Website visit duration
- Number of pages visited.

This is a **binary classification problem**, and we'll use a small neural network for quick execution.
